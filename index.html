                    Welcome to my weblog project! This website was built from scratch using HTML and CSS as a hands-on way to learn web development. The goal was to create a functional, visually organized page that reflects my interests while practicing coding skills. Through this project, I learned about structuring content with divs, styling with CSS, embedding images, and arranging text and media for readability. This weblog showcases different sections including my daily life, favorite things, and photos, demonstrating how a simple personal website can be both informative and engaging. It was a challenging but rewarding project, giving me insight into the planning, attention to detail, and problem-solving required in web development.

                    <td>
                        I usually wake up around 6:30 AM. The first thing I do is get ready for the day—brush my teeth, shower, and dress. I like to spend a few minutes reviewing my goals for the day and planning my schedule so I can stay organized and productive.

                    <td>
                        Breakfast is an important part of my morning routine. I usually eat something quick and energizing, like toast with peanut butter or eggs, paired with a cup of coffee or tea. I also sometimes catch up on the news or a podcast while eating.

                        During school hours, I attend my classes and participate in discussions. I take notes carefully and focus on understanding the material rather than just memorizing. I also make sure to ask questions if something isn’t clear and complete assignments on time to stay on track.

                    <td>
                        Lunch is a time to relax and recharge. I usually hang out with friends, share a meal, and sometimes discuss topics related to school or hobbies. It’s also a small mental break in the middle of a busy day, giving me time to clear my mind before afternoon classes.

                    <td>
                        After lunch, I attend remaining classes and work on projects or homework. This is when I focus on more intensive tasks or subjects that require deep concentration. I try to maintain productivity and complete assignments so that I don’t carry too much work into the evening.

                    <td>
                        Dinner is typically with family, providing time to catch up and share experiences from the day. It’s a time for conversation, relaxation, and enjoying a hearty meal. Sometimes we discuss plans for the weekend or reflect on accomplishments and challenges of the day.

                        Evenings are reserved for winding down. I might read, watch a show, or work on personal projects like coding or learning finance. Before bed, I reflect on the day, plan tasks for tomorrow, and try to get a good night’s sleep to be ready for the next day.

                    <strong>Favorite Movie:</strong> Batman Begins — I love how it dives into Bruce Wayne's journey from tragedy to heroism, the realistic approach to Gotham, and the dark tone that sets it apart from other superhero films. The storytelling and character development make it a movie I can watch over and over.

                <li>
                    <strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Pasta Arrabiata — I enjoy the bold flavors of this spicy Italian dish, the perfect balance of garlic, chili, and tomato sauce. It’s comforting, quick to make, and always satisfying after a long day.

                <li>
                    <strong>Favorite Sport:</strong> Basketball — I love both playing and watching basketball. The fast pace, strategy, teamwork, and skill involved make it exciting, and I particularly admire players like LeBron James for their versatility and leadership on the court.

                <li>
                    <strong>Favorite Hobby:</strong> Learning Finance — Understanding stocks, investments, and market dynamics is something I enjoy deeply.
